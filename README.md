# RepositoryList

Test task

- Fetch users and populate them into a list from https://api.github.com/users.
- When tapping on a user, display their repositories from https://api.github.com/users/{login}/repos.
- All data should be cached in an SQLite database.
- Implement pagination for the list of users and the list of repositories for each user.
- Initially, display cached data, and then fetch data from the API. The app should also work in offline mode.

Please attach a video demo of the project for a few seconds.

The design is arbitrary but should be clear and follow Google's recommendations.
Please complete the task using the MVVM architecture, Kotlin, and Android Compose.
Upload the completed task to GitHub.
